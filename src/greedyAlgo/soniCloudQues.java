//âœ… Explanation:
//This code implements a Greedy algorithm to reduce a number to zero using the minimum number of steps, using these two operations:
//
//If the number is even, divide it by 2.
//
//If the number is odd, subtract 1.
//
//It keeps a counter steps to count how many operations are performed.
